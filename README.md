# ml-models-comparison

comparison of machine learning models to predict loan approval

dataset source : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taweilo/loan-approval-classification-data

models that are used (or will be used):
 K-nearest neighbours
 Neural Network
 Xtreme gradient boosting



not needed, but show_raw_dataset infos can be executed to show infos about each columns

first execute prepare_data.py to make input data convenient for a ML model

then execute split_train_test.py to create train and test datasets 


then each jupyter notebook uses the models to predict test set, and is evaluated on it
